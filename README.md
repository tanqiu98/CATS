# From Category to Scenery
Code for ICPR 2024 paper "From Category to Scenery: An End-to-End Framework for Multi-Person Human-Object Interaction Recognition in Videos".

![](figures/overview.png)

We propose a novel end-to-end category to scenery framework, CATS, starting by generating geometric features for various categories through graphs respectively, then fusing them with corresponding visual features. Subsequently, we construct a scenery interactive graph with these enhanced geometric-visual features as nodes to learn the relationships among human and object categories. This methodological advance facilitates a deeper, more structured comprehension of interactions, bridging category-specific insights with broad scenery dynamics.

The code will be released soon...
